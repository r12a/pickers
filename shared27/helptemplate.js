  <h2 href="#basics">Basic use</h2>
<p>The controls just above the text area allow you to interact with or analyse the text in various ways. <strong>They nearly all work on any highlighted text within the text area, or if there is no highlight, on all the text.</strong> Controls near the bottom of the app allow you to change font, font size, line-height, text direction, etc.</p>
<p><b class="leadin" id="contrast">Contrast.</b> Some of the text on the UI has a lighter coloured text, so as to not swamp the key information. However, if you find it difficult to read the light-coloured text, click on <samp>Change contrast</samp> at the top right of the page to toggle between lighter and darker text. If you chose to save your settings between sessions, this will also be remembered.</p>
<p><b class="leadin">Sample text.</b> If you want to add some sample text to the text area, click on the <img src="../../shared26/images/sample.png" alt="Sample"/> icon.</p>
<p><b class="leadin">Fonts.</b>
To properly display the text you will need to choose a font that is loaded on your system or device, or use the web fonts downloaded with the page (the names end in ' WF'). Where applicable, the font list indicates which fonts are standard for Mac and Windows operating systems, and fonts that are freely available from Google and SIL. See more information about <a href="/scripts/fontlist/#khmer" target="_blank">standard OS fonts in Mac and Windows</a>.</p>
<p><b class="leadin" id="autofocus">Autofocus &amp; mobile devices.</b>
When working on an iPad or similar device, you should turn off <code class="kw" translate="no">Autofocus</code> (just below the text area). This prevents the keyboard popping up after you input every character.  (On older versions of iOS, you may also need to select a character twice to add it to the output field.)</p>
`
if (direction === 'rtl') out += `<p><b class="leadin">Text direction</b> The characters → ↔ ←︎︎︎ (just below the right side of the text area) allow you to set the base direction of the text area to LTR, auto, and RTL, respectively. The symbol ⇐︎ sets the direction to RTL override.</p>
<p>In some character apps you will also see the symbol ⭅︎ . This mirrors the character glyph at the same time as applying a RTL override.</p>
`

out += `
<p><b class="leadin" id="translit">Transliteration vs transcription.</b> Character apps distinguish between transliteration and transcription. In <strong>transliteration</strong> each native character has an equivalent Latin character associated with it. The transliteration may not accurately represent pronunciation, but does allow straightforward and reversible conversion between the two scripts. The transliteration schemes used here are specially created for materials on this site, and the app has controls to convert to and from that transliteration. A <strong>transcription</strong>, on the other hand, is more likely to be phonetically accurate (though may still reflect only an approximation), and is likely not to allow reversible conversions.</p>

<p><b class="leadin">Normalisation.</b> All text is output in Unicode normalisation form NFC by default.  You can change to NFD or no normalisation by clicking on the buttons in the yellow area. Note that normalization only takes place when you click on a character – text <em>pasted</em> into the box won't be normalised until you add another character from the UI, or set the normalisation explicitly.</p>

<p><b class="leadin">Secondary text area.</b> An area that opens up automatically just below the text area receives the output of various tools. Note that the text is editable.</p>
<p><img src="../../shared26/images/help/secondary_text.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>The icons to the right ( <img src="../../shared26/images/help/second_copy_etc.png" alt="" style="vertical-align:middle;"/> ) allow you to copy the contents of this area to the clipboard, insert the contents into the main text area, or close this subwindow, respectively. When you insert the contents of this subwindow into the main text area, the text will overwrite any highlighted text, otherwise it will just be inserted at the current cursor position.</p>
<p>Some conversions produce ambiguous output. In this case, you will be offered two alternatives on a yellow background, eg. <img src="../../shared26/images/help/alternatives.png" alt="" style="vertical-align:top;"/> presents you with the alternatives 'h' or 't'. Simply click on the alternative you want, and the app will discard the rest.</p>
